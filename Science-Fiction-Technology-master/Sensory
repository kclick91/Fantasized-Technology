- Ability to choose any distance as the distance that you hear, see, etc. the loudest, clearest, etc.
 - (ChatGPT) "Show 10 sensory capabilities similar to this one: 'Ability to choose any distance as the distance that you hear, see, etc. the loudest, clearest, etc.'"
1. Selective Sensory Filtering: The ability to selectively filter out specific sensory inputs or focus on specific sensory modalities, enhancing clarity and perception in chosen areas while reducing distractions.

2. Sensory Amplification: The capacity to amplify or enhance certain sensory signals, allowing for heightened sensitivity and perception in specific sensory domains such as hearing, vision, touch, or taste.

3. Multi-Sensory Fusion: The capability to integrate and fuse information from multiple sensory modalities, resulting in a richer and more comprehensive perception of the environment.

4. Adaptive Sensory Thresholds: The ability to dynamically adjust sensory thresholds, enabling the individual to perceive stimuli that fall within specific ranges, regardless of the absolute intensity of the stimulus.

5. Synesthesia-like Sensory Cross-Modal Associations: The capacity to experience sensory stimuli in one modality triggering sensations or perceptions in another modality, such as seeing colors in response to specific sounds or experiencing tastes when touching certain textures.

6. Time Perception Manipulation: The ability to manipulate the perception of time through sensory experiences, allowing for time to appear faster or slower depending on the individual's preference or situation.

7. Sensory Integration with Memory: The capability to integrate sensory inputs with memory recall, enabling vivid and detailed sensory memories that can be re-experienced with a high level of sensory fidelity.

8. Spatial Sensory Expansion/Compression: The capacity to expand or compress the perception of space in different sensory modalities, allowing for enhanced awareness of distant or nearby stimuli based on individual preference or situational requirements.

9. Sensory Adaptation: The ability to rapidly adapt to changing sensory environments, maintaining optimal perception and sensitivity across a wide range of sensory conditions or intensities.

10. Sensory Augmentation through Technological Interfaces: The use of technological interfaces or sensory prosthetics to enhance or expand sensory capabilities, such as wearable devices that provide enhanced hearing, vision, or tactile feedback beyond normal human limits.

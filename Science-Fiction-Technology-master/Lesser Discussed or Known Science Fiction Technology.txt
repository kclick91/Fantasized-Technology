Sure, here are 10 lesser-discussed science fiction technologies that could potentially improve or change society:

1. **Quantum Entanglement Communication**: Instantaneous communication across vast distances, bypassing the speed of light limitation.

2. **Neural Memory Transfer**: The ability to transfer memories from one brain to another could revolutionize education and therapy.

3. **Bio-Engineered Photosynthesis in Humans**: This could reduce our reliance on food consumption and address world hunger.

4. **Nano-Medicines**: Tiny robots that can perform surgeries or deliver medicines within the body with extreme precision.

5. **Matter Replication**: The ability to replicate objects could eliminate scarcity, but would need to be carefully managed.

6. **Emotion Control Technology**: Devices that can help regulate emotions could help with mental health issues.

7. **Gravity Control**: Manipulating gravity for transportation and other uses could drastically change infrastructure.

8. **Temporal Perception Manipulation**: If we could control our perception of time, we could potentially "slow down" time to increase productivity.

9. **Programmable Matter**: Materials that can change their properties based on programming could lead to all sorts of new inventions.

10. **Autonomous Self-Replicating Robots**: These could perform tasks such as cleaning up pollution or terraforming planets.

Remember, while these technologies are fascinating to think about, they also come with ethical, societal, and practical considerations that would need to be carefully addressed.

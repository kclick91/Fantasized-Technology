In the tapestry of life they intertwine,
Human and city, ages define.
Time's steady march, a dance sublime,
Both changing forms, yet holding rhyme.

A human, too, like seasons flow,
From youthful bud to wisdom's glow.
Though faces shift, and moments pass,
A core remains, a steadfast glass.

A city's streets, where footsteps tread,
Tell stories of the past widespread.
Modern fa√ßades on ancient ground,
Whisper tales without a sound.

Just as a city's spires aspire,
Humans reach for dreams entire.
Through trials faced and lessons learned,
A flame within forever burned.

The city's heart, a bustling core,
A human's soul, a fire to explore.
Purposes shift with changing days,
Yet essence holds, unyielding, stays.

A city's skyline, a changing face,
A human's journey, time can't erase.
Each layer added, a chapter anew,
Yet shadows linger, the old and true.

So as the river of time does flow,
Both city and human continue to grow.
Maintaining threads from ages past,
In futures unknown, they're steadfast.

# Science-Fiction-Technology
A repository of technologies that would be neat to exist whether found in science fiction or not.
This repository combines that already imagined technology of science fiction with tech that has not yet been imagined.

Collaborators can add their science fiction ideas or existing science fiction concepts to the repository.
